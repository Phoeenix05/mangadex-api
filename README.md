# Mangadex API

This project offers an API wrapper and Rust types for [MangaDex API (5.9)](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/redoc.html).

**NOTE: At This point in the development of this library I'm trying to create features / make the library work so
that it is as easy as possible to integrate with my MangaDex Reader project that uses Tauri**
