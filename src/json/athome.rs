//! This file is here just so that I don't get confused where
//! I put the struct for AtHomeServer (`./src/types.rs`).
//!
//! The response for this API route is different than any other
//! I have implemented right now from the beginning of the response.
//!
//! All other routes return a response that can be deserialized to
//! `MangaDexAPIResponse` struct.
